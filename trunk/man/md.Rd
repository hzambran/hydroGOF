\title{
Modified index of agreement
}
\description{
This function computes the modified Index of Agreement between \code{sim} and \code{obs}, with treatment of missing values. \cr
If 'x' is a matrix or a data frame, a vector of the modified index of agreement among the columns is returned.
}
\usage{
md(sim, obs, ...)

\method{md}{default}(sim, obs, j=1, na.rm=TRUE, ...)

\method{md}{data.frame}(sim, obs, j=1, na.rm=TRUE, ...)

\method{md}{matrix}(sim, obs, j=1, na.rm=TRUE, ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{sim}{
numeric, zoo, matrix or data.frame with simulated values
}
  \item{obs}{
numeric, zoo, matrix or data.frame with observed values
}
  \item{j}{
numeric, with the exponent to be used in the computation of the modified index of agreement. The default value is j=1.
}
  \item{na.rm}{
a logical value indicating whether 'NA' should be stripped before the computation proceeds. \cr
When an 'NA' value is found at the i-th position in \code{obs} \bold{OR} \code{sim}, the i-th value of \code{obs} \bold{AND} \code{sim} are removed before the computation.
}
  \item{\dots}{
further arguments passed to or from other methods.

\deqn{md = 1 - \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^N {(O_i - S_i)^j} } { \sum_{i=1}^N { \left| S_i -  \bar{O} \right| + \left| O_i -  \bar{O}  \right|^j } } }{%
md = [ 1 - ( sum( (obs - sim)^j ) ] /  sum( ( abs(sim - mean(obs)) + abs(obs - mean(obs))  )^j ) } 

The Index of Agreement (d) developed by Willmott (1981) as a standardized measure of the degree of model prediction error and varies between 0 and 1. \cr
A value of 1 indicates a perfect match, and 0 indicates no agreement at all (Willmott, 1981).

The index of agreement can detect additive and proportional differences in the observed and simulated means and variances; however, it is overly sensitive to extreme values due to the squared differences (Legates and McCabe, 1999).
}
\value{
Modified index of agreement between \code{sim} and \code{obs}. \cr

If \code{sim} and \code{obs} are matrixes, the returned value is a vector, with the modified index of agreement between each column of \code{sim} and \code{obs}.

\note{
\code{obs} and \code{sim} has to have the same length/dimension \cr

The missing values in \code{obs} and \code{sim} are removed before the computation proceeds, and only those positions with non-missing values in \code{obs} and \code{sim} are considered in the computation
