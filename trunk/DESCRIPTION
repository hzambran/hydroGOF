Description: S3 functions implementing both statistical and graphical
        goodness-of-fit measures between observed and simulated values,
        mainly oriented to be used during the calibration, validation,
        and application of hydrological models. Missing values in
        observed and/or simulated values can be removed before
        computations. Comments / questions / collaboration of any kind
        are very welcomed.
