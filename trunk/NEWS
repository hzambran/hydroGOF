NEWS/ChangeLog for hydroGOF
--------------------------

0.2-3	(under development)
	o TODO: plot2.R, line 196.
		Uncomment '#cex.axis=cex.axis,' when zoo_1.7-0 solves the issue.
	o TODO: replace 'drawxaxis' by 'drawTimeAxis' in all the package
	o NAMESPACE created, which leads to reduced dependency of the package hydroTSM.
	o hydroGOF now depends on xts >= 0.8-1 (=> zoo >= 1.7-0), in order to make use of improved plotting capabilities for ts objects.
	o now it depends on 'hydroTSM' >= 0.2-3, in order to use the re-written 'drawxaxis' function.
	o new function: 'wNSE', weighted Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency
	o new function: 'wsNSE', weighted seasonal Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency
	o new function: 'wl', weights to be used when focusing on low values
	o new function: 'wh', weights to be used when focusing on high values
	o new function: 'whl', weights to be used when focusing on high or low values	
	o 'plot2': -) better display of time series objects, when 'plot.type' is 'single'.
		      The (nicer) 'plot.xts' function is used instead of the previous 'plot.zoo'.
		   -) 'tick.tstep' and 'lab.tstep' now accept the values: "auto", "weeks", "hours", "minutes", 
		      "seconds", which should work with sub-daily time series
	o 'ggof' : -) better display of time series objects (by using the new 'plot2' and 'drawxaxis')
		   -) it works with xts objects as well.
		   -) 'tick.tstep' and 'lab.tstep' now accept the values: "auto", "quarters", "weeks", "hours", 
	 	      "minutes", and "seconds", and its default value was changed to "auto". 
	 	   -) the name of 'sim' and 'obs' are now used as default for the legend.
	o 'plotbands': -) better display of time series objects. The (nicer) 'plot.xts' function is used 
			  instead of the previous 'plot.zoo', and it uses the new 'drawTimeAxis' function.
		       -) 'tick.tstep' and 'lab.tstep' now accept the values: "auto", "quarters", "weeks", "hours", 
	 		  "minutes", and "seconds", and its default value was changed to "auto". 
	o 'plotbandsonly': -) it works with xts objects as well
			   -) 'legend' argument was removed (it was not used)
			   -) 'leg.cex' argument was removed (it was not used)
	o 'NSeff' : its name was changed to 'NSE'. The old name 'NSeff' is deprecated but is still working for backwards compatibility.
	o 'rNSeff': its name was changed to 'rNSE'. The old name 'rNSeff' is deprecated but is still working for backwards compatibility.
	o 'mNSeff': its name was changed to 'mNSE'. The old name 'mNSeff' is deprecated but is still working for backwards compatibility.
	o 'rd'    : A warning message is created when -at least one of- the observed values is/are zero,
	            which makes impossible to compute this index (thanks to Tom Purucker !)
	o 'rNSE'  : A warning message is created when -at least one of- the observed values is/are zero,
	            which makes impossible to compute this index
	o New dimension checking (number of columns and rows) for all the functions that are applied over a matrix or data.frame
	o fixed error in the documentation of 'rd' (thanks to Tom Purucker !)
	

0.2-2	14-Apr-2011
	o new function: 'KGE', Kling-Gupta efficiency
	o 'ggof': argument 'lab.fmt' is used now, and 'KGE' is shown in the GoF legend
	o 'plot2': KGE is showed in the GoF legend
	o SVN started to be used for package development in Rforge (thanks to Simon Urbanek for his great support)        
	o Updated dependence on R >= 2.10.0


0.2-1	30-Nov-2010

	o Minor changes in documentation
	o R functions were split up into individual files
	o new function: 'plotbandsonly', adds uncertainty bounds only to an existing plot
	o 'ggof': argument '...' is used now, and a new argument 'lab.fmt', for specifying the format of the axis' labels
	o 'plotbands':  arguments 'ylab', 'cex.axis', 'cex.lab' are used now. 
			argument 'legend' can now be logical (FALSE), in order to allow not having it.
			new arguments 'ylim', 'lab.fmt' (for specifying the format of the axis' labels)
			'sim' is now correctly plotted when 'type="points"' is used.
	o 'plot2': new argument: 'lab.fmt', for specifying the format of the axis' labels
