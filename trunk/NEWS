0.3-6-1	30-May-2013
        o 'valindex'     : false warning fixed. 
                           This warning raised the message "'sim' and 'obs' are empty or they do not have any common pair of elements with data !!",
                           even when 'sim' and 'obs' were fully compatible.

0.3-5	19-Oct-2012
	o now it depends on 'hydroTSM' >= 0.3-6, in order to allow handling sub-daily values in 'ggof'
        o 'ggof'      : -) now it handles sub-daily values in 'sim' and 'obs' (aggregation to daily/monthly/annual values not yet available)
                        -) 'dates' argument accepts 'POSIXct' objects
        o 'KGE'       : -) two new arguments: 'method', to allow KGE-2009 and KGE-2012 formulas, and 'out.type', in order to allow look at the
                           individual elements of the KGE (correlation, bias, and variability)
                        -) Added reference to Kling et al. 2012 and improved documentation
                        -) Added example to show difference between KGE-2009 and KGE-2012
                        -) now it returns NA instead of an error when there are no pairs of 'sim' and 'obs' without missing values 
                           (thanks to Giovanni Forzieri !)
        o DESCRIPTION : 'Author@R' field was replaced by 'Authors@R'                        
        
0.3-4	03-Jul-2012
        o new function 'VE', which computes the volumetric efficiency proposed by Criss and Winston 2008
         (thanks to Eric Morway for giving the final push to include it !)
        o 'gof'   : VE is now included in the computed goodness-of-fit measures
        o 'ggof'  : VE is now included in the computed goodness-of-fit measures
        o 'plot2' : VE is now included in the computed goodness-of-fit measures (when 'leg.gof=TRUE')
        o function '.intersect' was removed and function 'valindex' was improved in order to replace it
        o 'zoo' package was moved from 'Imports' to 'Depends'
        o 'methods' package is now imported, in order to avoid problems with Rscript, which currently does not load 'methods'
        
0.3-3	02-May-2012
        o 'gof'   : added new example and description of the output class (thanks to Kris Jaeger !)
	o 'br2'   : the new example included in version 0.3-2 was improved
        o 'ggof'  : fixed problem with 'ylim' when some elements in 'sim' or 'obs' were NA (the issue was in the 'plot2' function)
	o 'plot2' : fixed problem with 'ylim' when some elements in 'x' or 'y' were NA
	            
0.3-2	07-Oct-2011
	o 'br2'   : fixed documentation error in its formula (thanks to Jan Corluy !), and a new example was added.
	            Its value was already computed in the correct way.
	
0.3-1	14-Sep-2011
	o 'ggof'  : fixed problem when 'ylim' is specified by the user (the issue was in the 'plot2' function)
	o 'plot2' : fixed problem when 'ylim' is specified by the user

0.3-0	01-Sep-2011

	o NAMESPACE created, which leads to reduced dependency on the package hydroTSM.
	o hydroGOF now depends on xts >= 0.8-2 (=> zoo >= 1.7-2), in order to make use of improved plotting capabilities for ts objects.
          The first release of 'xts' after the 0.8-0 (which was set as the default building block for plotting time series in hydroTSM) 
          was the 0.8-2, and appeared on CRAN on August 9th, 2011       
	o now it depends on 'hydroTSM' >= 0.3-0, in order to use the re-written 'drawxaxis/drawTimeAxis' function.	
	o a vignette is now included with the package, in order to illustrate some basic functionality of hydroGOF
	o 'plot2'        : -) better display of time series objects, when 'plot.type' is 'single'.
		              The (nicer) 'plot.xts' function is used instead of the previous 'plot.zoo'.
		           -) 'tick.tstep' and 'lab.tstep' now accept the values: "auto", "weeks", "hours", "minutes", 
		              "seconds", which should work with sub-daily time series
		           -) when 'cal.ini' is provided, all the values in 'obs' and 'sim' with dates previous to 'cal.ini' are SKIPPED 
		              from the computation of the goodness-of-fit measures (when 'gof.leg=TRUE'), but their values are still plotted, 
		              in order to examine if the warming up period was too short, acceptable or too long for the chosen calibration
		              period.
		           -) fixed problem with the 'cex.axis' argument when 'plot.type="multiple"' (this was a zoo problem, and it was 
		              fixed in zoo_1.7-1).		           
	o 'ggof'         : -) better display of time series objects (by using the new 'plot2' and 'drawxaxis/drawTimeAxis')
		           -) it works with xts objects as well.
		           -) 'tick.tstep' and 'lab.tstep' now accept the values: "auto", "quarters", "weeks", "hours", 
	 	              "minutes", and "seconds", and its default value was changed to "auto". 
	 	           -) the name of 'sim' and 'obs' are now used as default for the legend.
	 	           -) when 'cal.ini' is provided, all the values in 'obs' and 'sim' with dates previous to 'cal.ini' are SKIPPED 
		              from the computation of the goodness-of-fit measures (when 'gof.leg=TRUE'), but their values are still plotted, 
		              in order to examine if the warming up period was too short, acceptable or too long for the chosen calibration
		              period.
		           -) added error checking for 'ftype' when 'sim' and 'obs' are not time series.
	o 'plotbands'    : -) better display of time series objects. The (nicer) 'plot.xts' function is used 
			      instead of the previous 'plot.zoo', and it uses the new 'drawTimeAxis' function.
		           -) 'tick.tstep' and 'lab.tstep' now accept the values: "auto", "quarters", "weeks", "hours", 
	 		      "minutes", and "seconds", and its default value was changed to "auto". 
	o 'plotbandsonly': -) it works with xts objects as well
			   -) 'legend' argument was removed (it was not used)
			   -) 'leg.cex' argument was removed (it was not used)
	o 'NSeff'   : -) its name was changed to 'NSE'. The old name 'NSeff' is deprecated but is still working for backwards compatibility.
	              -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'rNSeff'  : -) its name was changed to 'rNSE'. The old name 'rNSeff' is deprecated but is still working for backwards compatibility.
	              -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'mNSeff'  : -) its name was changed to 'mNSE'. The old name 'mNSeff' is deprecated but is still working for backwards compatibility.
	              -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'rd'      : -) a warning message is created when -at least one of- the observed values is/are zero,
	                 which makes impossible to compute this index (thanks to Tom Purucker !)
	              -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'rNSE'    : -) a warning message is created when -at least one of- the observed values is/are zero,
	                 which makes impossible to compute this index
	              -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'md'      : -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'pbias'   : -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'pbiasfdc': -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'pfactor' : -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'rfactor' : -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'rSD'     : -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'RSR'     : -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'NRMSE'   : -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'KGE'     : -) now it returns NA instead of '-Inf' when the denominator of Alpha or Beta were equal to zero.	
	o 'rd'      : -) fixed documentation error in its formula (thanks to Tom Purucker !). Its value was already computed in the correct way.
	o New dimension checking (number of columns and rows) for all the functions that are applied over a matrix or data.frame
