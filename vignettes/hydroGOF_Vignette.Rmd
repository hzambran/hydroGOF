# Installation

Installing hydroGOF:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("hydroGOF")
```


# Setting up the environment

-  Loading the *hydroGOF* library, which contains data and functions used in this analysis.
```{r message=FALSE}
library(hydroGOF)
```

-  Loading observed streamflows of the Ega River (Spain), with daily data from 1961-Jan-01 up to 1970-Dec-31

```{r }
require(zoo)
data(EgaEnEstellaQts)
obs <- EgaEnEstellaQts
```

-  Generating a simulated daily time series, initially equal to the observed values (simulated values are usually read from the output files of the hydrological model)

```{r }
sim <- obs 
```

-  Computing the numeric goodness-of-fit measures for the "best" (unattainable) case

```{r }
gof(sim=sim, obs=obs)
```

-  Randomly changing the first 2000 elements of 'sim', by using a normal distribution with mean 10 and standard deviation equal to 1 (default of 'rnorm').

```{r }
sim[1:2000] <- obs[1:2000] + rnorm(2000, mean=10)
```

-  Plotting the graphical comparison of 'obs' against 'sim', along with the numeric goodness-of-fit measures for the daily and monthly time series 

```{r fig=TRUE, pdf=TRUE, eps=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
ggof(sim=sim, obs=obs, ftype="dm", FUN=mean)
```




## Removing warm-up period

-  Using the first two years (1961-1962) as warm-up period, and removing the corresponding observed and simulated values from the computation of the goodness-of-fit measures:
```{r fig=TRUE, pdf=TRUE, eps=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
ggof(sim=sim, obs=obs, ftype="dm", FUN=mean, cal.ini="1963-01-01")
```


-  Verification of the goodness-of-fit measures for the daily values after removing the warm-up period:
```{r }
sim <- window(sim, start=as.Date("1963-01-01"))
obs <- window(obs, start=as.Date("1963-01-01"))

gof(sim, obs)
```




## Analysis of the residuals


-  Computing the daily residuals (even if this is a dummy example, it is enough for illustrating the capability)

```{r }
r <- sim-obs
```

-  Summarizing and plotting the residuals (it requires the hydroTSM package):

```{r }
library(hydroTSM)
smry(r) 
```

```{r fig=TRUE, pdf=TRUE, fig.width=12, fig.height=14}
# daily, monthly and annual plots, boxplots and histograms
hydroplot(r, FUN=mean)
```


-  Seasonal plots and boxplots
```{r fig=TRUE, eval=TRUE, pdf=TRUE, eps=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=10}
# daily, monthly and annual plots, boxplots and histograms
hydroplot(r, FUN=mean, pfreq="seasonal")
```
