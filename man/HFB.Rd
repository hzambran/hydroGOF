\arguments{
  \item{sim}{
numeric, zoo, matrix or data.frame with simulated values
}
  \item{obs}{
numeric, zoo, matrix or data.frame with observed values
}
  \item{na.rm}{
a logical value indicating whether 'NA' should be stripped before the computation proceeds. \cr
When an 'NA' value is found at the i-th position in \code{obs} \bold{OR} \code{sim}, the i-th value of \code{obs} \bold{AND} \code{sim} are removed before the computation.
}
  \item{hQ.thr}{
numeric, representing the exceedence probabiliy used to identify high flows in \code{obs}. All values in \code{obs} that are equal or higher than \code{quantile(obs, probs=(1-hQ.thr))} are considered as high flows. By default \code{hQ.thr=0.1}. \cr
On the other hand, the high values in \code{sim} are those located at the same i-th position than the i-th value of the \code{obs} deemed as high flows. 
}
  \item{start.month}{
[OPTIONAL]. Only used when the (hydrological) year of interest is different from the calendar year.

numeric in [1:12] indicating the starting month of the (hydrological) year. Numeric values in [1, 12] represent months in [January, December]. By default \code{start.month=1}.
}
  \item{out.PerYear}{
logical, indicating whether the output of this function has to include the median annual high-flows bias obtained for the individual years in \code{sim} and \code{obs} or not.
}
  \item{fun}{
function to be applied to \code{sim} and \code{obs} in order to obtain transformed values thereof before computing this goodness-of-fit index.

The first argument MUST BE a numeric vector with any name (e.g., \code{x}), and additional arguments are passed using \code{\dots}.
}
  \item{\dots}{
arguments passed to \code{fun}, in addition to the mandatory first numeric vector.
}
  \item{epsilon.type}{
argument used to define a numeric value to be added to both \code{sim} and \code{obs} before applying \code{fun}. 

It is was  designed to allow the use of logarithm and other similar functions that do not work with zero values.

Valid values of \code{epsilon.type} are:

1) \kbd{"none"}: \code{sim} and \code{obs} are used by \code{fun} without the addition of any numeric value. This is the default option.

2) \kbd{"Pushpalatha2012"}: one hundredth (1/100) of the mean observed values is added to both \code{sim} and \code{obs} before applying \code{fun}, as described in Pushpalatha et al. (2012). 

3) \kbd{"otherFactor"}: the numeric value defined in the \code{epsilon.value} argument is used to multiply the the mean observed values, instead of the one hundredth (1/100) described in Pushpalatha et al. (2012). The resulting value is then added to both \code{sim} and \code{obs}, before applying \code{fun}.

4) \kbd{"otherValue"}: the numeric value defined in the \code{epsilon.value} argument is directly added to both \code{sim} and \code{obs}, before applying \code{fun}.

\details{
The median annual high flow bias (HFB) is designed to drive the calibration of hydrological models focused in the reproduction of high-flow events. 

The high flow bias (HFB) ranges from 0 to Inf, with an optimal value of 0. Higher values of HFB indicate stronger differences between the high values of \code{sim} and \code{obs}. Essentially, the closer to 0, the more similar the high values of \code{sim} and \code{obs} are. 

The HFB function is inspired in the annual peak-flow bias (APFB) objective function proposed by Mizukami et al. (2019). However, it has four important diferences:

1) instead of considering only the observed annual peak flow in each year, it considers all the high flows in each year, where "high flows" are all the values above a user-defined quantile of the observed values, by default 0.9 (\code{hQ.thr=0.1}).

2) insted of considering only the simulated high flows for each year, which might occur in a date/time different from the date in which occurs the observed annual peak flow, it considers as many high simulated flows as the number of high observed flows for each year, each one in the exact same date/time in which the corresponding observed high flow occurred.

3) for each year, instead of using a single bias value (i.e., the bias in the single annual peak flow), it uses the median of all the bias in the user-defined high flows 

4) when computing the final value of this metric, instead o using the mean of the annual values, it uses the median, in order to take a stronger representation of the bias when its distribution is not symetric.

\value{
If \code{out.PerYear=FALSE}: numeric with the median high flow bias between \code{sim} and \code{obs}. If \code{sim} and \code{obs} are matrices, the output value is a vector, with the high flow bias between each column of \code{sim} and \code{obs}.

If \code{out.PerYear=TRUE}: a list of two elements:
\item{HFB.value}{
numeric with the median annual high flow bias between \code{sim} and \code{obs}. If \code{sim} and \code{obs} are matrices, the output value is a vector, with the median annual high flow bias between each column of \code{sim} and \code{obs}.
}
\item{HFB.PerYear}{
-) If \code{sim} and \code{obs} are not data.frame/matrix, the output is numeric, with the median high flow bias obtained for the individual years between \code{sim} and \code{obs}. 

-) If \code{sim} and \code{obs} are data.frame/matrix, this output is a data.frame, with the median high flow bias obtained for the individual years between \code{sim} and \code{obs}.

\code{obs} and \code{sim} has to have the same length/dimension \cr
