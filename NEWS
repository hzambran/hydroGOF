        o citation with DOI is now possible (and new CITATION file).
        o 'NSE'         : -) three new arguments (FUN, epsilon, epsilon.value), added to allow pre-processing simulated and observed values (e.g., log, sqrt, 1/x)                                              
        o 'KGE'         : -) now works correctly when 'out.type="full"', even if 'sim' and 'obs' do not have a single element in common (i.e., results in labelled NAs)
        o 'd'           : -) now it returns NA when it is not possible to compute the index of agreement (sum((abs(sim-Om)+abs(obs-Om))^2)=0)

0.3-5	19-Oct-2012
	o now it depends on 'hydroTSM' >= 0.3-6, in order to allow handling sub-daily values in 'ggof'
        o 'ggof'      : -) now it handles sub-daily values in 'sim' and 'obs' (aggregation to daily/monthly/annual values not yet available)
                        -) 'dates' argument accepts 'POSIXct' objects
        o 'KGE'       : -) two new arguments: 'method', to allow KGE-2009 and KGE-2012 formulas, and 'out.type', in order to allow look at the
                           individual elements of the KGE (correlation, bias, and variability)
                        -) Added reference to Kling et al. 2012 and improved documentation
                        -) Added example to show difference between KGE-2009 and KGE-2012
                        -) now it returns NA instead of an error when there are no pairs of 'sim' and 'obs' without missing values 
                           (thanks to Giovanni Forzieri !)
        o DESCRIPTION : 'Author@R' field was replaced by 'Authors@R'                        
        
0.3-4	03-Jul-2012
        o new function 'VE', which computes the volumetric efficiency proposed by Criss and Winston 2008
         (thanks to Eric Morway for giving the final push to include it !)
        o 'gof'   : VE is now included in the computed goodness-of-fit measures
        o 'ggof'  : VE is now included in the computed goodness-of-fit measures
        o 'plot2' : VE is now included in the computed goodness-of-fit measures (when 'leg.gof=TRUE')

        o 'zoo' package was moved from 'Imports' to 'Depends'
        o 'methods' package is now imported, in order to avoid problems with Rscript, which currently does not load 'methods'
        
0.3-3	02-May-2012
        o 'gof'   : added new example and description of the output class (thanks to Kris Jaeger !)
	o 'br2'   : the new example included in version 0.3-2 was improved
        o 'ggof'  : fixed problem with 'ylim' when some elements in 'sim' or 'obs' were NA (the issue was in the 'plot2' function)

0.3-2	07-Oct-2011
	o 'br2'   : fixed documentation error in its formula (thanks to Jan Corluy !), and a new example was added.
	            Its value was already computed in the correct way.
	
0.3-1	14-Sep-2011
	o 'ggof'  : fixed problem when 'ylim' is specified by the user (the issue was in the 'plot2' function)
	o 'plot2' : fixed problem when 'ylim' is specified by the user

0.3-0	01-Sep-2011

	o NAMESPACE created, which leads to reduced dependency on the package hydroTSM.
	o hydroGOF now depends on xts >= 0.8-2 (=> zoo >= 1.7-2), in order to make use of improved plotting capabilities for ts objects.
          The first release of 'xts' after the 0.8-0 (which was set as the default building block for plotting time series in hydroTSM) 
          was the 0.8-2, and appeared on CRAN on August 9th, 2011       
	o now it depends on 'hydroTSM' >= 0.3-0, in order to use the re-written 'drawxaxis/drawTimeAxis' function.	
	o a vignette is now included with the package, in order to illustrate some basic functionality of hydroGOF
	o 'plot2'        : -) better display of time series objects, when 'plot.type' is 'single'.
		              The (nicer) 'plot.xts' function is used instead of the previous 'plot.zoo'.
		           -) 'tick.tstep' and 'lab.tstep' now accept the values: "auto", "weeks", "hours", "minutes", 
		              "seconds", which should work with sub-daily time series
		           -) when 'cal.ini' is provided, all the values in 'obs' and 'sim' with dates previous to 'cal.ini' are SKIPPED 
		              from the computation of the goodness-of-fit measures (when 'gof.leg=TRUE'), but their values are still plotted, 
		              in order to examine if the warming up period was too short, acceptable or too long for the chosen calibration
		              period.
		           -) fixed problem with the 'cex.axis' argument when 'plot.type="multiple"' (this was a zoo problem, and it was 
		              fixed in zoo_1.7-1).		           
	o 'ggof'         : -) better display of time series objects (by using the new 'plot2' and 'drawxaxis/drawTimeAxis')
		           -) it works with xts objects as well.
		           -) 'tick.tstep' and 'lab.tstep' now accept the values: "auto", "quarters", "weeks", "hours", 
	 	              "minutes", and "seconds", and its default value was changed to "auto". 
	 	           -) the name of 'sim' and 'obs' are now used as default for the legend.
	 	           -) when 'cal.ini' is provided, all the values in 'obs' and 'sim' with dates previous to 'cal.ini' are SKIPPED 
		              from the computation of the goodness-of-fit measures (when 'gof.leg=TRUE'), but their values are still plotted, 
		              in order to examine if the warming up period was too short, acceptable or too long for the chosen calibration
		              period.
		           -) added error checking for 'ftype' when 'sim' and 'obs' are not time series.
	o 'plotbands'    : -) better display of time series objects. The (nicer) 'plot.xts' function is used 
			      instead of the previous 'plot.zoo', and it uses the new 'drawTimeAxis' function.
		           -) 'tick.tstep' and 'lab.tstep' now accept the values: "auto", "quarters", "weeks", "hours", 
	 		      "minutes", and "seconds", and its default value was changed to "auto". 
	o 'plotbandsonly': -) it works with xts objects as well
			   -) 'legend' argument was removed (it was not used)
			   -) 'leg.cex' argument was removed (it was not used)
	o 'NSeff'   : -) its name was changed to 'NSE'. The old name 'NSeff' is deprecated but is still working for backwards compatibility.
	              -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'rNSeff'  : -) its name was changed to 'rNSE'. The old name 'rNSeff' is deprecated but is still working for backwards compatibility.
	              -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'mNSeff'  : -) its name was changed to 'mNSE'. The old name 'mNSeff' is deprecated but is still working for backwards compatibility.
	              -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'rd'      : -) a warning message is created when -at least one of- the observed values is/are zero,
	                 which makes impossible to compute this index (thanks to Tom Purucker !)
	              -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'rNSE'    : -) a warning message is created when -at least one of- the observed values is/are zero,
	                 which makes impossible to compute this index
	              -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'md'      : -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'pbias'   : -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'pbiasfdc': -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'pfactor' : -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'rfactor' : -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'rSD'     : -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'RSR'     : -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'NRMSE'   : -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'KGE'     : -) now it returns NA instead of '-Inf' when the denominator of Alpha or Beta were equal to zero.	
	o 'rd'      : -) fixed documentation error in its formula (thanks to Tom Purucker !). Its value was already computed in the correct way.
	o New dimension checking (number of columns and rows) for all the functions that are applied over a matrix or data.frame
