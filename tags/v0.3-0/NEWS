NEWS/ChangeLog for hydroGOF
--------------------------


0.3-0	01-Sep-2011

	o NAMESPACE created, which leads to reduced dependency on the package hydroTSM.
	o hydroGOF now depends on xts >= 0.8-2 (=> zoo >= 1.7-2), in order to make use of improved plotting capabilities for ts objects.
          The first release of 'xts' after the 0.8-0 (which was set as the default building block for plotting time series in hydroTSM) 
          was the 0.8-2, and appeared on CRAN on August 9th, 2011       
	o now it depends on 'hydroTSM' >= 0.3-0, in order to use the re-written 'drawxaxis/drawTimeAxis' function.	
	o A vignette is now included with the package, in order to illustrate some basic functionality of the package
	o 'plot2'        : -) better display of time series objects, when 'plot.type' is 'single'.
		              The (nicer) 'plot.xts' function is used instead of the previous 'plot.zoo'.
		           -) 'tick.tstep' and 'lab.tstep' now accept the values: "auto", "weeks", "hours", "minutes", 
		              "seconds", which should work with sub-daily time series
		           -) when 'cal.ini' is provided, all the values in 'obs' and 'sim' with dates previous to 'cal.ini' are SKIPPED 
		              from the computation of the goodness-of-fit measures (when 'gof.leg=TRUE'), but their values are still plotted, 
		              in order to examine if the warming up period was too short, acceptable or too long for the chosen calibration
		              period.
		           -) fixed problem with the 'cex.axis' argument when 'plot.type="multiple"' (this was a zoo problem, and it was 
		              fixed in zoo_1.7-1).		           
	o 'ggof'         : -) better display of time series objects (by using the new 'plot2' and 'drawxaxis/drawTimeAxis')
		           -) it works with xts objects as well.
		           -) 'tick.tstep' and 'lab.tstep' now accept the values: "auto", "quarters", "weeks", "hours", 
	 	              "minutes", and "seconds", and its default value was changed to "auto". 
	 	           -) the name of 'sim' and 'obs' are now used as default for the legend.
	 	           -) when 'cal.ini' is provided, all the values in 'obs' and 'sim' with dates previous to 'cal.ini' are SKIPPED 
		              from the computation of the goodness-of-fit measures (when 'gof.leg=TRUE'), but their values are still plotted, 
		              in order to examine if the warming up period was too short, acceptable or too long for the chosen calibration
		              period.
		           -) added error checking for 'ftype' when 'sim' and 'obs' are not time series.
	o 'plotbands'    : -) better display of time series objects. The (nicer) 'plot.xts' function is used 
			      instead of the previous 'plot.zoo', and it uses the new 'drawTimeAxis' function.
		           -) 'tick.tstep' and 'lab.tstep' now accept the values: "auto", "quarters", "weeks", "hours", 
	 		      "minutes", and "seconds", and its default value was changed to "auto". 
	o 'plotbandsonly': -) it works with xts objects as well
			   -) 'legend' argument was removed (it was not used)
			   -) 'leg.cex' argument was removed (it was not used)
	o 'NSeff'   : -) its name was changed to 'NSE'. The old name 'NSeff' is deprecated but is still working for backwards compatibility.
	              -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'rNSeff'  : -) its name was changed to 'rNSE'. The old name 'rNSeff' is deprecated but is still working for backwards compatibility.
	              -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'mNSeff'  : -) its name was changed to 'mNSE'. The old name 'mNSeff' is deprecated but is still working for backwards compatibility.
	              -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'rd'      : -) a warning message is created when -at least one of- the observed values is/are zero,
	                 which makes impossible to compute this index (thanks to Tom Purucker !)
	              -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'rNSE'    : -) a warning message is created when -at least one of- the observed values is/are zero,
	                 which makes impossible to compute this index
	              -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'md'      : -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'pbias'   : -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'pbiasfdc': -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'pfactor' : -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'rfactor' : -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'rSD'     : -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'RSR'     : -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'NRMSE'   : -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'KGE'     : -) now it returns NA instead of '-Inf' when the denominator of Alpha or Beta were equal to zero.	
	o New dimension checking (number of columns and rows) for all the functions that are applied over a matrix or data.frame
	o fixed error in the documentation of 'rd' (thanks to Tom Purucker !)
	

0.2-2	14-Apr-2011

	o new function: 'KGE', Kling-Gupta efficiency
	o 'ggof': argument 'lab.fmt' is used now, and 'KGE' is shown in the GoF legend
	o 'plot2': KGE is showed in the GoF legend
	o SVN started to be used for package development in Rforge (thanks to Simon Urbanek for his great support)        
	o Updated dependence on R >= 2.10.0


0.2-1	30-Nov-2010

	o Minor changes in documentation
	o R functions were split up into individual files
	o new function: 'plotbandsonly', adds uncertainty bounds only to an existing plot
	o 'ggof': argument '...' is used now, and a new argument 'lab.fmt', for specifying the format of the axis' labels
	o 'plotbands':  arguments 'ylab', 'cex.axis', 'cex.lab' are used now. 
			argument 'legend' can now be logical (FALSE), in order to allow not having it.
			new arguments 'ylim', 'lab.fmt' (for specifying the format of the axis' labels)
			'sim' is now correctly plotted when 'type="points"' is used.
	o 'plot2': new argument: 'lab.fmt', for specifying the format of the axis' labels
