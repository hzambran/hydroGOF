        o 'ggof'      : -) now it handles sub-daily values in 'sim' and 'obs' (aggregation to daily/monthly/annual values not yet available)
                        -) 'dates' argument accepts 'POSIXct' objects
        o 'KGE'       : -) two new arguments: 'method', to allow KGE-2009 and KGE-2012 formulas, and 'out.type', in order to allow look at the

                        -) Added reference to Kling et al. 2012 and improved documentation
                        -) Added example to show difference between KGE-2009 and KGE-2012
                        -) now it returns NA instead of an error when there are no pairs of 'sim' and 'obs' without missing values

        o DESCRIPTION : 'Author@R' field was replaced by 'Authors@R'                        
        

# Changes in version  0.3-4	03-Jul-2012
        o new function 'VE', which computes the volumetric efficiency proposed by Criss and Winston 2008

# Changes in version  0.3-1	14-Sep-2011
        o 'ggof'  : fixed problem when 'ylim' is specified by the user (the issue was in the 'plot2' function)
        o 'plot2' : fixed problem when 'ylim' is specified by the user


# Changes in version  0.3-0	01-Sep-2011
        o NAMESPACE created, which leads to reduced dependency on the package hydroTSM.
        o hydroGOF now depends on xts >= 0.8-2 (=> zoo >= 1.7-2), in order to make use of improved plotting capabilities for ts objects.
          The first release of 'xts' after the 0.8-0 (which was set as the default building block for plotting time series in hydroTSM) 
          was the 0.8-2, and appeared on CRAN on August 9th, 2011       
        o now it depends on 'hydroTSM' >= 0.3-0, in order to use the re-written 'drawxaxis/drawTimeAxis' function.	
        o a vignette is now included with the package, in order to illustrate some basic functionality of hydroGOF
        o 'plot2'        : -) better display of time series objects, when 'plot.type' is 'single'.
		                      The (nicer) 'plot.xts' function is used instead of the previous 'plot.zoo'.
		                   -) 'tick.tstep' and 'lab.tstep' now accept the values: "auto", "weeks", "hours", "minutes", 
		                       "seconds", which should work with sub-daily time series
		                   -) when 'cal.ini' is provided, all the values in 'obs' and 'sim' with dates previous to 'cal.ini' are SKIPPED 
		                      from the computation of the goodness-of-fit measures (when 'gof.leg=TRUE'), but their values are still plotted, 
		                      in order to examine if the warming up period was too short, acceptable or too long for the chosen calibration
		                      period.
		                   -) fixed problem with the 'cex.axis' argument when 'plot.type="multiple"' (this was a zoo problem, and it was 
		                      fixed in zoo_1.7-1).		           
	o 'ggof'         :     -) better display of time series objects (by using the new 'plot2' and 'drawxaxis/drawTimeAxis')
		                   -) it works with xts objects as well.
		                   -) 'tick.tstep' and 'lab.tstep' now accept the values: "auto", "quarters", "weeks", "hours", 
	 	                      "minutes", and "seconds", and its default value was changed to "auto". 
	 	                   -) the name of 'sim' and 'obs' are now used as default for the legend.
	 	                   -) when 'cal.ini' is provided, all the values in 'obs' and 'sim' with dates previous to 'cal.ini' are SKIPPED 
		                      from the computation of the goodness-of-fit measures (when 'gof.leg=TRUE'), but their values are still plotted, 
		                      in order to examine if the warming up period was too short, acceptable or too long for the chosen calibration
		                      period.
		                   -) added error checking for 'ftype' when 'sim' and 'obs' are not time series.
	o 'plotbands'    :     -) better display of time series objects. The (nicer) 'plot.xts' function is used 
			                  instead of the previous 'plot.zoo', and it uses the new 'drawTimeAxis' function.
		                   -) 'tick.tstep' and 'lab.tstep' now accept the values: "auto", "quarters", "weeks", "hours", 
	 		                  "minutes", and "seconds", and its default value was changed to "auto". 
	o 'plotbandsonly':     -) it works with xts objects as well
			               -) 'legend' argument was removed (it was not used)
			               -) 'leg.cex' argument was removed (it was not used)
	o 'NSeff'        :     -) its name was changed to 'NSE'. The old name 'NSeff' is deprecated but is still working for backwards compatibility.
	                       -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'rNSeff'       :     -) its name was changed to 'rNSE'. The old name 'rNSeff' is deprecated but is still working for backwards compatibility.
	                       -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'mNSeff'       :     -) its name was changed to 'mNSE'. The old name 'mNSeff' is deprecated but is still working for backwards compatibility.
	                       -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'rd'           :     -) a warning message is created when -at least one of- the observed values is/are zero,
	                          which makes impossible to compute this index (thanks to Tom Purucker !)
	                       -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'rNSE'         :     -) a warning message is created when -at least one of- the observed values is/are zero,
	                          which makes impossible to compute this index
	                       -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'md'           :     -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'pbias'        :     -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'pbiasfdc'     :     -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'pfactor'      :     -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'rfactor'      :     -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'rSD'          :     -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'RSR'          :     -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'NRMSE'        :     -) now it returns NA instead of an error when the denominator of its formula is equal to zero.
	o 'KGE'          :     -) now it returns NA instead of '-Inf' when the denominator of Alpha or Beta were equal to zero.	
	o 'rd'           :     -) fixed documentation error in its formula (thanks to Tom Purucker !). Its value was already computed in the correct way.
	o New dimension checking (number of columns and rows) for all the functions that are applied over a matrix or data.frame
